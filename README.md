## 🗃️ About

Banco de Dados Geral is an experimental web application consisting of a CRUD with PHP and SQL, hosted for free.

It aims to be a storage in which small merchants record their business data. On the platform, the user can register their customers, employees, addresses, products, sales and suppliers; after registering them, it is possible to consult, edit or delete them.

It was done in 2021 as a Database exercise, at the time I was studying SQl and had basic knowledge of Javascript, HTML and CSS.
